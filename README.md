# Payload Obfuscation Framework

A Python-based project demonstrating basic payload obfuscation and encoding techniques used in cybersecurity research and analysis.


## Purpose

The objective of this project is to understand how payloads can be transformed using encoding and obfuscation techniques. This helps in understanding how detection systems work and how modified payloads behave during analysis.


## Features

- Payload encoding techniques
- Basic obfuscation methods
- Modular Python structure
- Educational demonstration of payload transformation

## Architecture

The framework follows a modular structure:

- main.py — Entry point for payload processing
- evasion/ — Encoding and obfuscation techniques
- payloads/ — Sample payload inputs
- screenshots/ — Demonstration images

This modular design allows easy addition of new evasion techniques and payload formats.
