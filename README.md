# Payload Obfuscation Framework

A Python-based project demonstrating basic payload obfuscation and encoding techniques used in cybersecurity research and analysis.


## Purpose

The objective of this project is to understand how payloads can be transformed using encoding and obfuscation techniques. This helps in understanding how detection systems work and how modified payloads behave during analysis.


## Features

- Payload encoding techniques
- Basic obfuscation methods
- Modular Python structure
- Educational demonstration of payload transformation
