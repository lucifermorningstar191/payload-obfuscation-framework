# Payload Obfuscation Framework

A Python-based project demonstrating basic payload obfuscation and encoding techniques used in cybersecurity research and analysis.


## Purpose

The objective of this project is to understand how payloads can be transformed using encoding and obfuscation techniques. This helps in understanding how detection systems work and how modified payloads behave during analysis.


## Features

- Payload encoding techniques
- Basic obfuscation methods
- Modular Python structure
- Educational demonstration of payload transformation

## Architecture

The framework follows a modular structure:

- main.py — Entry point for payload processing
- evasion/ — Encoding and obfuscation techniques
- payloads/ — Sample payload inputs
- screenshots/ — Demonstration images

This modular design allows easy addition of new evasion techniques and payload formats.


## Features

- Modular payload processing framework
- Basic payload obfuscation workflow
- Organized evasion technique structure
- Easy extension for new encoding methods
- Designed for security learning and research purposes


## Disclaimer

This project is developed for educational and research purposes only.
The framework is intended to demonstrate payload obfuscation concepts used in cybersecurity research and defensive analysis.
Do not use this project against systems without proper authorization.


## Future Improvements

- Add multiple encoding techniques
- CLI argument support
- Logging functionality
- Automated payload testing
- Integration with security lab environments
