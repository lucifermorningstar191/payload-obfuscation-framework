# Payload Obfuscation Framework

A Python-based framework designed to demonstrate payload obfuscation techniques used in cybersecurity for understanding detection evasion and defensive analysis.
This project focuses on transforming payloads using encoding and obfuscation methods to simulate how adversaries modify payloads to bypass signature-based detection systems.

## Purpose

Adversaries often modify payloads to evade security controls such as antivirus signatures, IDS/IPS rules, and static detection mechanisms. 

This project was created to:
- Understand payload transformation techniques
- Demonstrate encoding and obfuscation concepts
- Explore how defensive tools detect modified payloads
- Improve understanding of offensive and defensive security workflows

This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.


## Features

- Base64 payload encoding
- XOR-based obfuscation
- Modular framework structure
- Easy extension for additional encoding techniques
- Python-based implementation
