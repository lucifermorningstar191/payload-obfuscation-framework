#  Payload Obfuscation Framework

## Overview

The Payload Obfuscation Framework is a Python-based learning project designed to demonstrate payload transformation and obfuscation concepts used in cybersecurity.  

This project explores how payloads can be modified through encoding and transformation techniques, and how such changes may affect detection and analysis processes in defensive security environments.

This project is intended strictly for educational and research purposes.

---

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand and demonstrate payload obfuscation concepts commonly discussed in red team and defensive security workflows.  

The framework was developed as a hands-on learning exercise to explore:

- Payload transformation techniques
- Basic encoding mechanisms
- How obfuscation impacts analysis and detection
- Structured development of security-focused tools

---

## Features

- Modular project structure
- Payload encoding and transformation examples
- Simple command-line execution
- Easy extension for additional encoding methods
- Organized payload and evasion modules
